This bot keeps us motivated writing overleaf documents, continuously reminding us why we are doing what we do.

* Creating necessary keys

To be able to run this code, you need a few environment variables. These are:

| Key Name             | Description                                                                |
|----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DISCORD_TOKEN        | Discord bot token                                                          |
| DISCORD_CHANNEL      | The channel ID to send messages in                                         |
| OVERLEAF_SESSION_KEY | Overleaf session cookie                                                    |
| OVERLEAF_DOC_ID      | Overleaf document id. This can be found in the URL. A 24 character long ID |

These can either be an environment variable, or saved in `Secrets.toml`

Example toml:

#+BEGIN_SRC toml
DISCORD_TOKEN="<Discord bot token>"
DISCORD_CHANNEL="<The channel to send messages in>"
OVERLEAF_SESSION_KEY="<Overleaf session cookie>"
OVERLEAF_DOC_ID="<Overleaf id found in URL>"
#+END_SRC

The overleaf session key can be found in the `overleaf_session2` cookie.
